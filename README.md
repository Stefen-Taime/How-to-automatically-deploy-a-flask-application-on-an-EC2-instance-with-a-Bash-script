# How-to-automatically-deploy-a-flask-application-on-an-EC2-instance-with-a-Bash-script


The learning objectives:
The main motivation for this mini-project is to get familiar with using Bash Scripting and the AWS CLI to automate command line tasks. This particular repo contains a configuration script that automatically creates an EC2 instance, accesses it via SSH, installs dependencies and hosts a simple Flask application using the image taken from Docker Hub.
